# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

This project's client is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. Liam required a program to be designed that trains students for the driving test at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV) by offering driving lessons, practice tests, and classes. The DriverPass system is web-based and must be available on any platform. 

# What did you do particularly well?

I did very well in creating the business and system requirements. As a result, I am confident I included everything necessary for the design of the DriverPass system to be a success. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would redo my logging-in use case diagram because it could create an infinite loop. So I would add to the login feature to show minimum attempts to log in, then exit or reset if the minimum number of times failed. 

# How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

Before implementing user needs into the system design, the first step is to define them by reading the interview transcript thoroughly. Then, I jotted down all of the information in the transcript, which was interpretable as a deliverable. Once I wrote down everything that was deliverable, I reviewed the transcript again to ensure I got everything. In the next step, I considered whether those requirements could be addressed via software or externally. The external requirements were put aside, and I focused on the deliverables that applied to the software development. I then determined the "actors" of the system (who would be involved in using the system and how they are involved). My next step was to integrate them into the design. Consequently, I divided them into the most basic tasks to make use cases for each. In designing a system, it's essential to include the user's needs to achieve what the owner wants from that system. Your client will be dissatisfied if you don't, and you'll have to spend more time implementing their requests, wasting time, resources, and money. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

While developing software, I will first read and write down all the requirements and what are the most critical factors. My next step is isolating the system's objects and analyzing their interaction; this will be done using a UML Class Diagram. Before returning to a class diagram, I jot down the system's processes in a process diagram. By building these diagrams, I can take note of things I might have missed; instead of just jumping right into coding. It also is an opportunity to present to the client to ensure everything is noticed and if anything needs to be added before creating the system. Then, once I finally have the diagrams complete and approved, I will begin to code the software.
